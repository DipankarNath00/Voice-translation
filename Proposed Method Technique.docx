Chapter 4: Proposed Method/Technique

1.1. Proposed Algorithm/Technique

The voice translation system implements a multi-stage pipeline for processing audio content:

1. Audio Input Processing:
   - Direct voice recording through browser's Web Audio API
   - YouTube video audio extraction (first 1 minute)
   - Audio format standardization (16kHz, mono, MP3)

2. Speech Recognition:
   - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API integration
   - Language-specific recognition models
   - Automatic punctuation and formatting

3. Translation Pipeline:
   - Deep Translator integration for text translation
   - Support for multiple language pairs
   - Context-aware translation handling

4. Text-to-Speech Synthesis:
   - Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) integration
   - Natural-sounding voice synthesis
   - Language-specific voice models

5. Military Mode (Optional):
   - End-to-end encryption using Fernet
   - Secure key management
   - Location tracking and alert system

1.2. Proposed System Design

The system architecture follows a client-server model with the following components:

1. Frontend (Web Interface):
   - Responsive Bootstrap-based UI
   - Real-time audio recording and playback
   - Language selection interface
   - Translation history display
   - Military mode toggle

2. Backend (Flask Application):
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - User authentication and session management
   - Audio processing pipeline orchestration
   - Database integration (Supabase)
   - File management system

3. External Services Integration:
   - Google Cloud Platform:
     * Speech-to-Text API
     * Translate API
     * Cloud Storage
   - YouTube Data API (via yt-dlp)
   - Email service for alerts

4. Database Schema:
   - Users table (authentication)
   - Translation history
   - Audio file metadata
   - Security logs
